Lets solve it, this is buffer overflow the classic one

So maybe i'm still learning about binary exploit which is kinda fun for me. As you, on these line 
```
void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}
```

are the vulnerability about buffer overflow line. Another vulnerability: 

```
char buf1[100];
  gets(buf1);
```

yet still buffer overflow. what is that? buffer overflow is kinda one of the weakness system that buffering array from it limit. So should be like if you input A till 16, maybe still doesn't happen. However if you input A till 20, it will get buffer overflow. 

# 『Solver』

So you just do `nc <host> <port>` and buffering till break it array. Here i give you and example when you try to debug it:

This is still on array. lets try put A till 20:

as you can see, it will break the array and the program gain `signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault` and it will crash the program. 

So here are the solver that i solve:

- using nc:

- using [script solver.py](https://github.com/Lunalight-Yui/PicoCTF/blob/main/binary%20exploit/medium/buffer%20overflow%200/source/script/solver.py):
