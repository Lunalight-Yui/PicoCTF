#  『The challenge』

So this is the challenge:

It seems sql injection, but lets try to solve this one!

#  『Solving challenge』
> Solve by: Lylera_

So first of all, we know in the hint that `Developers sometimes leave notes in the code; but not always in plain` which mean we must `inspect element` as always. So i try to `inspect`, here the result:

It seems something weird code and if you take a look on second hint `A common trick is to rotate each letter by 13 positions in the alphabet` which mean this could be `ROT - 13`. So lets give it a shot!

So the message tell use that `X-Dev-Access: yes` which mean we can use this to bypass the login system. So lets try

#  『Flag』

I use `burpsuite` to intercept this and can change the header as always. So here the result:

By giving email and `X-Dev-Access: yes`, we can bypass login system as i mention in early. Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Here we got the flag!

```
Flag: picoCTF{brut4_f0rc4_cbb8faa7}
```
