# „Äécrack the gate 2„Äè
> The login system has been upgraded with a basic rate-limiting mechanism that locks out repeated failed attempts from the same source. We‚Äôve received a tip that the system might still trust user-controlled headers.
> Your objective is to bypass the rate-limiting restriction and log in using the known email address: ctf-player@picoctf.org and uncover the hidden secret.

# „ÄéThe challenge„Äè

We were given this challenge. Same as `crack the gate 1` but different method. So here the challenge:

And given `password.txt`:

So lets solve!

# „ÄéSolving challenge„Äè
> Solve by: Lylera_

As you can see on `The challenge`, we were given login page. Based on the hint, we were redirected to this website:

We can `fake ip` to bypass this login. So lets solve. I use `burpsuite` to solve this one! So here the solve:

lets use `intercept: on` and try to detect first.

Here the result:

As you can see, we can't use any password. Only given password allows it. So lets try with giving password.txt:

<img width="571" height="190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b593ec1-d28e-402c-81e9-d4d56070f8f0" />

Unfortunately, we can use this password because it getting some limit.

# „ÄéFlag„Äè

As my conclusion, we can use another password to bypass this one. Here the result:

<img width="572" height="335" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7217590-83ac-4827-b05a-83286774f2dd" />

<img width="553" height="266" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd72f6d9-83c7-4f07-bea0-fcc984c8ddfd" />

Idk how it can be happen if i try it. But maybe some of this can getting the flag using `X-Forwarded-For`. I still learn how to use this one ü§î.
