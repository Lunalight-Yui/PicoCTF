Solve:

Web inspector is a tool where you can analyze the code, application like cookie, local storage, etc. You can use `ctrl + shift + i` for using it or right click and click `inspect` or `f12`. Here how i solve it

This is the template website, nothing suspicious like normal website.

How about we search on `about`?

Nope. Nothing suspicious at all. 

Alright, let me how i solve it. Remember the description `web inspector` which mean you must use web inspect by using `ctrl + shift + i` or right click and click `inspect`

This is web inspector where you can inspect the element / coding of the front ent website (html). Inside, you can see any information about website like title, hidden files, etc. So what do you think?
welp, i'm curious with `about`. why? there is a message `try inspecting the page!! You might find it there` . Alright, lets do it!
> fyi, you can click `...` to see the code one by one or go to `sources` to see full of code.

as you can see. There is suspicious in here. Look the code
```
<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9">
   <h1>
    Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there
   </h1>
   <!-- .about-container -->
  </section>
```
Suspicious on `notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9"` right? Try to decode this `cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9` using base64. 
> how i take that? right click then `Edit as HTML` and you can copy that code.
