Hint: 
1. Sometimes, the most important information is hidden in plain sight. Have you checked all parts of the webpage?
2. Cookies aren't just for eating - they're also used in web technologies!
3. Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a webpage, including things you can't see directly.

**Solve**: 

Cookie is food. But in here, cookie are text files with small pieces of data. It stored information from user like login detail, preference, or shopping cart. There are 2 main kind of cookie: Session cookie and persistent cookie. 
Session cookie is temporary storage. What is that mean? it mean, session cookie is just saving your data temporary. For example, if you open the browser (right now), you get session cookie to inform server that you're login on that example
and this can be vulnerable because if you're admin and another people know your session cookie, you get a problem. For now, i will not discuss about that. In this session, i will talk about session cookie on challenge.

Here is a template of the website

This is a template of login page. In here, you can login and set username whatever. For example, i will use `username: Ly, password: a`

Once you login, the page looks like this:

You get hint on this page. `Hint: Have you checked your cookies lately?` Sound suspicious, right? well, yess. You can inspect this page by pressing `f12` or `ctrl + shift + i` or right click and click `inspect`.

This is template of web inspect. There are many section. But don't worry! i will guide you how to get the cookie. Search section `application` and click `> cookies`. Click the arrow, and you get like this:

There you go! It is session cookie. You can `double click` under value or you can double click on section `Cookie values`. You will get this: `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzQ3MzZGNkNCfQ`
