# Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!
> Link challenge: https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/426?category=1&page=1

Hint: 
1. Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try curl <URL> in your shell.
2. Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
3. What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

Solve:

Another challenge using web inspector. So here is a template

<img width="1918" height="538" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-01 073253" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdab96f0-0023-4710-a256-f95949ecd3ac" />

Simple template and nothing suspicious right? Just picture with the texts that something useful if you read it. 
There is a hint on this template `your browser has succesfully received the flag.` meaning you get the flag but don't know where is it, right?

Well try using `f12` or `ctrl + shift + i` or right click and then click `inspect`

<img width="1408" height="912" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-01 073837" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c749f5a-f25b-42a4-acc0-85064ab33d8b" />

And there you go. Inspect code has been succeffully. You can search on section `Elements` or section `Sources`. So it is up to you. But i prefer `sources` and i open this section

<img width="1727" height="878" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-01 074105" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dec70ec9-a6c9-4c84-8087-33755a79a483" />

Full of code. This is subclass `index.html`. You can read about front end page and as you can see, there is a class name `picoCTF{}` which mean this is just labelling to make easy of code. There is 1 line that make me interest to read it
is this one (if you can't find, i give you 3 line)

```
<p class="picoctf{}">If you're reading this, your browser has succesfully received the flag.</p>
<p class="picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_dbe259ce}"></p>
<p class="picoctf{}">I just deliver flags, I don't know how to read them...</p>
```

Flag:
```
picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_dbe259ce}
```
